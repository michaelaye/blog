I would find this a weird selection effect and would propose that this is caused by differences between mp3 (less efficient) and ac3 (more efficient)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Volume control is after pairing with headset blocked on iPhone and solely done via the headset&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With the P590 next and previous track selection does NOT work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even high data rate songs in m4a format (lossless) play nicely via the headset. They /might/ sound a bit better, but that might be wishful thinking as the bluetooth encoder might reduce that quality all away&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;So overall I am very pleased that this is finally in the iPhone OS, pity that next track does not work with the P590, but I am looking anyway for a new Stereo Bluetooth headset, want to try in-ear plugs this time.</description><category>a2dp</category><category>headset</category><category>iphone</category><guid>http://michaelaye.blogspot.com/posts/200906a2dp-on-iphone-with-p590.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2009 13:15:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
