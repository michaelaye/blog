This includes rotational curves of galaxies, but also structure formation at all during development in the Universe, and gravitational lenses.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;By the way, the last point is interesting: If you don't trust the evidence of the existence of Dark Matter for gravitational lenses, it basically means you don't trust General Relativity. That way you need a whole lot more of extra explanation to do, if you want to do without Dark Matter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In conclusion (I know, this could be a whole lot more clearly written, and maybe I do one day), Dark Matter is safe, it's only Dark Energy that's a bit mystic still.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To come back to the post title.. it's also interesting how the SPIEGEL news science writer abuses the potential questioning of the Copernican principle, which states that we don't live in a special place in the Universe, to make it sound like one should even question that the Earth is rotating around the Sun. :(&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As a friend of mine stated, he already sees the Creationists jumping up and down in joy...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;man man man...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I guess I should start up writing again for raumfahrer.net, they as a student project seem to have higher standards then the professional and paid SPIEGEL writers.. a pity..&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ok, enough for this year's rant.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Enjoy your autumn everybody, or should I say, singlebody, counting the numbers of my readers.. ;)&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>dark energy</category><category>dark matter</category><category>spiegel</category><guid>http://michaelaye.blogspot.com/posts/200810spiegel-online-science-news-thumbs-down.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2008 09:52:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
