<html><body><p>Yess!<br>Just booked my conference in Venice about Particle Astrophysics.<br>Isn't it cool to be paid to go to Venice (first timer in Venice) and even hear about newest results in the coolest job possible, palavering around Dark Matter, Dark Energy and all the other high energy stuff flying around. :) I love my job...<br>Have a look where I am going:<br><a href="http://www.pd.infn.it/TeV/local.html">Link to conference page</a><br>and <a href="http://www.hotelgabrielli.it/hotel-venezia/en/index.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">my hotel</span></a><br>Ok, probably I won't have water view, booking a single room (they are always the worst), but getting out of the hotel, first thing I see is the water. Nice! :D<br>But first I go for 2 weeks holidays to the Ukraine to the family of Anya. This is a nice summer! The postponed launch of Dawn has more and more nice sides to it.</p></body></html>
