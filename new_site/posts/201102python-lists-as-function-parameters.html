<html><body><p>I often stumble about something like this:<br>A function needs 2 parameters like<br>myfunction(a,b)<br>and i have them, but inside a list 'myList'=[a,b].<br>Sure I could write <br></p><div>myfunction(myList[0],myList[1]), </div><div>but where's the famous Python beauty in this, right?<br>Until I realised that this is what the *args thingie is for that I never used before.<br>Damn, all those typing hours lost when I typed the explicit unpacking of lists!!!<br>Now I can just do<br>myfunction(*myList)<br>and all is beautiful again! ;)<br>Thank you, Python</div></body></html>
