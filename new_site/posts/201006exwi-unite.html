WTF? Obviously a case of 'kick u out, get somebody cheaper=younger'. I wondered, if anybody would join a signature list to the cafeteria bosses, to stop this bullshit! Also, we could use this opportunity to complain about some 'worseprovements' they introduced after the change of ownership, like canceling the speaker phone etc. </span><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Who is with me and would sign something like that?</span></div></body></html>
